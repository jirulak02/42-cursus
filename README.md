# 42-cursus - 2023

This is the main core program of 42 Prague school.

42 is a worldwide network of free private schools. This school does not have any teachers or classes. Everything is learned by making projects and by sharing knowledge with other peers. The core of the program is coded in C and C++. Later you can branch out into other languages, such as C#, Python, Swift and many more.
